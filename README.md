Sign Language Translation Using Computer Vision
A computer vision-based project to translate sign language gestures into text. This project leverages deep learning and image processing techniques to recognize hand signs and convert them into their corresponding letters or words, making it easier for people who are not familiar with sign language to understand it.

Introduction
This project aims to create a real-time sign language translation system using computer vision. By capturing hand gestures through a webcam or video feed, the model identifies each gesture and translates it to text. This project can serve as a helpful tool for bridging communication between people who use sign language and those unfamiliar with it.

Features
Real-time detection of hand signs through webcam input
Classification of hand signs into their corresponding letters/words
Conversion of hand signs into readable text
Display of translated text on the screen for easier understanding
Requirements
The following tools and libraries are required for running this project:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow/Keras
Numpy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
You can install the necessary packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-translation
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd sign-language-translation
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To start the application and run real-time sign language translation, execute:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Example Workflow
Capture: The webcam captures hand gestures.
Process: The captured frames are processed and preprocessed for the model.
Classify: The model classifies the hand gesture into a letter or word.
Display: The recognized letter/word is displayed as text on the screen.

Dataset
The project uses a dataset of hand gestures representing letters or words. You can use an existing dataset, such as the American Sign Language (ASL) dataset, or create your own by capturing and labeling images of hand gestures.

Dataset Link: ASL Alphabet Dataset
Place the dataset in the dataset/ folder for easy access.

Model
The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. Training can be performed on the provided dataset to recognize each sign accurately. The trained model can then be used to classify real-time webcam input.

Training
To train the model, run:

bash
Copy code
python src/model.py
Future Enhancements
Add support for different sign languages (e.g., BSL, ISL).
Integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentence formation.
Improve the model’s accuracy by incorporating more data and advanced architectures.
Add multi-hand gesture detection for complex words or phrases.
